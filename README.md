FROGGER game

GitHub repository for my coursework for COMP2042 Software Maintenence. It is a Frogger game that I am refactoring and changing. 
This repository consists of:
1. README.md file
2. A class dagram of the game structure (classes, interfaces, relationships and multiplicity)
3. The Javadoc source code for the Frogger game
4. A short video of the Frogger game running

This project requires a Java IDE. Import the necessary files into a project in the IDE to run.
